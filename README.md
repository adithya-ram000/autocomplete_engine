# 🔍 Autocomplete Engine in C++

This project implements a **prefix-based autocomplete system** using a **Trie** data structure, written in C++.

## ✨ Features

- Fast prefix search
- Top suggestions based on frequency
- Modular C++ code (Trie + main logic)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
autocomplete_engine/
├── main.cpp           # Entry point
├── autocomplete.cpp   # Trie logic implementation
├── trie.h             # Trie structure definitions
├── words.txt          # Word list with frequencies
└── README.md          # This file
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open terminal inside this folder  
2. Compile the project: g++ main.cpp autocomplete.cpp -o autocomplete
3. Run the executable: ./autocomplete
4. Type a prefix to get top 5 matching suggestions.

## 📚 Notes

This project is part of a DSA-focused portfolio created while learning **Tries** and **C++ STL**.  
It simulates autocomplete like you'd find in a search engine or IDE.
